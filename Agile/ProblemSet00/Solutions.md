1)How does agile testing (development) methodology differ from other testing (development) methodologies?

	Waterfall is rigid and has a sequential phase that is always followed throughout the process, while agile is flexible and it has timeboxed events called sprints where the lifecycle of development is carried out. While all the other development methodologies consider the process to be a single project, the agile considers the projects as several mini projects, and with each mini project completion the user is made to check with the product and then the product is deployed, thus adding the inputs of the user to the product and gaining the satisfaction of the user too.

2)What are the most important components of Agile?

	The important methodology components of agile are epic, features, user stories and tasks.

3)What is difference between Epic,features, User stories & Tasks?

	An epic is a big work that is of a common objective (i.e.) it could be of a feature or features. The end product is  the epic, whereas the feature is an attribute and is of value to the client as it is a client-valued function. User story is the fundamental work that is to be done in a project. Several tasks when done together forms a user story. The user stories when added with the features forms the end proct which is the epic.

4)Explain what is a product backlog in Scrum

	The scrum product backlog is a replacement for the traditional requirements and the backlog consists of all the details that must be done in the project. They are of technical nature unlike the tradidtional requirements. A scrum product backlog is a to-do list and is handled by the product owner and the scrum master along with the teammates.

5)What is Scrum Sprint?

	A sprint in a scrum is time-boxed event which is mostly of two weeks and can range upto two months where a prodcut increment is developed and deployed after a demo is given to the product owner.

6)What are the artifacts of Scrum process?

	The scrum artifacts are product backlog, monitoring the progress towards the goal, sprint backlog,  monitroing the sprint progress, and the product increment.

7)What do you understand by sprint backlog?

	A sprint backlog is a set of product backlog items that has been selected for the sprint. It aslo consists of the plan that is to be followed to develop the increment in the sprint and it helps to realize the sprint goal. The sprint backlog gives the details that makes the description of the product backlog a completed increment.

8)What is the role of the Product Owner?

	The main role of the product owner is to have a vision of the end product and to convey it properly to the scrum team via the product backlog. The product owner has to check the result of each sprint and must be always available, since the scrum team can complete the product at any time within the sprints. The product owner must alos be engaged with the team.

9)What are the different roles in Scrum?

	The various roles in scrum are the Business Analyst, Scrum Team, Scrum Product Owner, and the Scrum Master. 

10)What are the responsibilities of a Scrum Master?

	The scrum Master is the person who motivates the scrum team to do the work and must also enforce the team to adhere to scrum theory and rules.

11)What are different ceremonies and their importance in Scrum?

	The different ceremonies in Scrum are Stand-up, Sprint Planning, Sprint Demo, Sprint Retrospective, User Story Growing and Sprint Review. The ceremonies help the scrum team, scrum master and the product owner to communicate with each other and keep each other in the light of the things that are happening.

12)What is the difference between Sprint Planning Meeting and Sprint Retrospective Meeting?

	The Sprint planning is the ceremony in which the Scrum Master, the product owner and the scrum team meet with each other. The product backlog is the output of the sprint planning. It is done on the first day of the sprint.
	Whereas, the Sprint Retrospective is done afeter the sprint review, where the team meets up along with the scrum master and the product owner and carries on with a discussion about the things that went well, the things that didn't go well, the appreciations and the areas to be improved for the whole team.

13)What is the difference between agile & scrum?

	A Scrum is a type of agile approach that can be followed, while agile is the software development methodology that introduces iterative and incremental development of products.

14)Explain Agile in 30 seconds.

	Agile software development is a set of principles for software development in which there is an evolving change in requirements and it enforces the concept of using cross functional and self organized teams to develop a working software.

15)What is the Daily Stand-Up?

	The meeting which are in a timebox within 5-15 minutes. The meeting must be held everyday at the same place and time throughout the project. Each member discusses the progress of their work and, the team can clarify with each other and it provides an opportunity to collaborate and ask for help from the others.
